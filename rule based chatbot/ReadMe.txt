THERE ARE MAINLY TWO TYPES OD CHATBOTS:
1)RULE-BASED CHATBOT
2)SELF LEARNING CHATBOT

HERE WE HAVE MADE A RULE BASED CHATBOT USING PYTHON LANGUAGE

WE HAVE USED NLTK i.e., Natural Language ToolKit to make the chatbot understand what we want to convey.
In our code, we imported two tools (chat,reflections).

*Chat: It is a class that contain complete logic for processing the text data which the chat bot receives.
*Reflections: It is a dictionary containing basic input and corresponding outputs.
